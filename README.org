* Info
This repository contains my personal MacOS dotfiles for programs including, but not limited to,
- Kitty
- Doom Emacs
- Yabai (literate)
- CAVA
- tmux
- fish
- skhd (literate)
- sketchybar
- and more
These files were designed for use on my system, which is a 2020 M1 MacBook Air running MacOS Ventura. They may not work for your system.

* Emacs Fork
The Emacs fork that I use is a fork called emacs-plus, which was designed for use with MacOS. You can install it with
#+begin_src shell
brew install emacs-plus --with-no-titlebar --with-native-comp
#+end_src
I use Doom Emacs, which you can install with
#+begin_src shell
git clone --depth 1 --single-branch https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs ~/.config/emacs
~/.config/emacs/bin/doom install
#+end_src

* Updates
** Colorscheme
- Switched to the Dracula colorscheme
** Bar
- Switched to a bar with powerline, as well as changing the colors to match with Dracula colors a little better.
- Changed the *WWW* space to be the first space in the bar, as I spend most of my time there anyways.
** Yabai
- Rewrote my yabairc in Emacs ORG mode mainly as an experiment, but also to educate people about what each line in my config does and make it easier to jump to various sections, as well as making it easier for people to steal from it.
- Turned off opacity based focus, as it was a little distracting
** SKHD
- Rewrote my config in org mode, cleaned up some unneeded keybindings.
- Fixed the keybinding to move a window to a different space
** Emacs
- Switched to a literate config.org
- Installed dashboard.el in order to be able to see my org-agenda items and recent files on the homescreen

- Thanks to [[https://www.youtube.com/c/DistroTube/videos][DistroTube - YouTube]] for providing the basis for many of my config files, as well as getting me into Emacs, which I simultaneausly hate him for and cannot thank him enough for.
